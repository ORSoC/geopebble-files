* Updating MCU
  First, put MCU in programming mode by connecting the board and running:
    sudo usb_modeswitch -v 09fb -p 6001 -H -V 2047 -P 0200
  Because the MCU does not emulate the entirety of the Huawei mode switching hack,
  usb_modeswitch will produce an error:
    Error: Huawei control message failed (error -9). Abort
  This is not actually a failure. You can confirm with lsusb that the "Altera Blaster"
  device has been replaced by "Texas Instruments MSP430 USB HID Bootstrap Loader". 
  That is the MSP430 in USB programming mode. 
 
  Once the bootloader is running, the firmware can be replaced. A modified version of 
  python-msp430-tools is used:
    PYTHONPATH=python-msp430-tools python -m msp430.bsl5.hid -B -e -P ordb3a_firmware
  Output:
    Downloading utility routines...
    Programming...
    Programming: OK

  The device now holds the new firmware. lsusb -vd 09fb:6001 will, for instance, show 
  that the most recent firmware has a CDC serial port (which shows up as /dev/ttyACM0,
  or another number if there are more CDC ports - TI MSP-FET430UIF has one). 

  Note that the firmware is rather sensitive code. Since it is responsible for the 
  critical tasks of adjusting voltages and communication, a firmware which fails to
  start may turn an entire module unusable (until reawakened with a possibly modified 
  bootstrap procedure). We intended to make unassisted boostrapping possible (via just
  a USB cable) but it is not possible because of the 1.8V startup voltage. We worked 
  around this using a separate bootstrap board driving MSP430 debug and power chip 
  enable and control signals.
